<h3>About</h3>

<p>The D4Sign API is one of the many ways to use electronic signature to authenticate and sign documents with maximum security.</p>

<p>This is a test using and integrating them Web API to do requests and receive responses about the sign proccess. For this, I use C#, RestSharp to make requests and NewtonSoft to treat Json file. <p/>

<p>The objective of this project is clarify the integration with API's that can be used to accomplish and send documents for eletronic signature. The objective isn't explain how this API works.</P>

<h3>How to start?</h3>

  </li>
  
  
  <li>
    <p>After this, you need to create a demo account on his website to generate your tokenAPI and cryptKey. You can do it accessing this link: http://demo.d4sign.com.br/login</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>With your tokenAPI and cryptKey, entry in GenericRepository class and insert it in the constructor of the class. </p>
